NOTE: This was made on a PDAFT client running from DIVALoader, lyb's tlac additions & with Cainan's MDATA.
I think it will work with other combinations, but if it doesn't, try this.

TUTORIAL: Remove pv_db from the rom folder and add this pv_db.
Then, remove mdata_pv_db from MDATA/M270/rom and add this mdata_pv_db.

Credits and a list of currently translated songs are in credits.txt .

I own nothing! If anyone wants me to remove the translations i will do so.

Currently translated progress : 30 / 240
